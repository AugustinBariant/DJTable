# DJTable
DJTable is a project done at the KTH course "Advanced Graphics and Interaction". DJTable is a collaborative music experience.
The project consists of a 3D environment with which the user can interact to combine some sounds and produce simple music. 

The application is running on a tabletop surface called Samsung Surface 2.0. By placing different 3D objects (fiducials) on top of the table the user can create different sounds of a different instrument. There are eight different sound: Kick, Snare, Bass, Percu, Hihat, Lead, Strings, and Wind. By rotating the fiducials clockwise the user can get four different tracks of the same instrument. Bringing two or more fiducials close to each other causes fifth track that is a mixture of those fiducials.

## How should I build it?
